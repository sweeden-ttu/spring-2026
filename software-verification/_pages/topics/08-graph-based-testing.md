# Topic 8: Graph-based Testing

## Overview

Graph-based testing uses graph representations of software to design and generate test cases. This approach is useful for testing systems with complex control flow or state transitions.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand graph-based testing principles
- Create graph representations of software
- Generate test paths from graphs
- Apply graph coverage criteria

## Key Concepts

- **Control Flow Graphs**: Representing program control flow
- **State Graphs**: Representing system states and transitions
- **Path Coverage**: Testing paths through graphs
- **Node Coverage**: Testing graph nodes
- **Edge Coverage**: Testing graph edges
