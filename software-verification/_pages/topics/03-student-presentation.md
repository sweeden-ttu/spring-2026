- **Tool Evaluation**: Hands-on experience with modern testing and verification tools
- **Professional Development**: Practice technical communication and presentation skills

## Presentation Topics

Students may choose from a variety of topics or propose their own based on course content and current research:

### Research Papers and Case Studies
- Recent advances in software testing methodologies
- Industry case studies of V&V in practice
- Formal verification in real-world systems
- AI/ML testing and evaluation techniques

### Tool Demonstrations and Evaluations
- LangSmith for LLM testing and evaluation
- Automated testing frameworks and tools
- Model checking tools and applications
- Coverage analysis and testing metrics tools

### Industry Practices and Experiences

## Best Practices

### Before Your Presentation

1. **Practice Multiple Times**: Rehearse your presentation several times
2. **Test Equipment**: Verify all software and equipment works beforehand
3. **Prepare Backup Plans**: Have alternatives if technology fails
4. **Time Yourself**: Ensure you stay within the allocated time
5. **Anticipate Questions**: Think about likely questions and prepare answers

### During Your Presentation

1. **Engage the Audience**: Make eye contact and encourage participation
2. **Explain Clearly**: Avoid jargon or explain technical terms
3. **Use Visuals Effectively**: Point out key elements in diagrams and code
4. **Pace Yourself**: Speak clearly and at an appropriate pace
5. **Handle Questions Gracefully**: It's okay to say "I'll need to research that"

### After Your Presentation

1. **Reflect on Feedback**: Consider comments and suggestions
2. **Follow Up**: Answer any questions you couldn't address during Q&A
3. **Share Resources**: Provide links or materials if requested
4. **Continue Learning**: Use the experience to improve future presentations
