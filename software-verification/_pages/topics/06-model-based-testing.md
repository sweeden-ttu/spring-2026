# Topic 6: Model-based Testing

## Overview

Model-based testing uses models of the system under test to generate test cases automatically. This approach can improve test coverage and efficiency.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand model-based testing principles
- Create models for testing
- Generate test cases from models
- Apply model-based testing tools

## Key Concepts

- **Test Models**: Abstract representations of system behavior
- **Model Coverage**: Ensuring model coverage criteria
- **Test Generation**: Automatic test case generation
- **Model Validation**: Verifying model correctness
- **Tool Support**: Model-based testing frameworks
