# Topic 11: Formal Verification

## Overview

Formal verification uses mathematical methods to prove that software satisfies its specifications. This provides strong guarantees about software correctness.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand formal verification principles
- Apply formal methods to software verification
- Use theorem provers and verification tools
- Prove properties of software systems

## Key Concepts

- **Formal Specifications**: Mathematical descriptions of requirements
- **Theorem Proving**: Proving correctness properties
- **Proof Assistants**: Tools for constructing proofs
- **Specification Languages**: Languages for formal specifications
- **Verification Methods**: Various formal verification approaches
