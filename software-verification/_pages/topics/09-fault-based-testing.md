# Topic 9: Fault-based Testing & Fault Localization

## Overview

Fault-based testing focuses on detecting specific types of faults, while fault localization identifies the location of faults in code when tests fail.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand fault-based testing principles
- Apply mutation testing techniques
- Use fault localization tools
- Identify and isolate faults in code

## Key Concepts

- **Mutation Testing**: Creating and testing mutants
- **Fault Models**: Representations of common faults
- **Fault Localization**: Identifying fault locations
- **Debugging Techniques**: Systematic fault finding
- **Automated Tools**: Fault detection and localization tools

## Related Lectures
