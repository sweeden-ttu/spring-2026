# Topic 13: Model Checking

## Overview

Model checking is an automated technique for verifying that finite-state systems satisfy temporal logic specifications. It is widely used for hardware and software verification.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand model checking principles
- Create models for verification
- Specify properties using temporal logic
- Use model checking tools

## Key Concepts

- **Finite-State Models**: Models with finite states
- **Temporal Logic**: Logic for specifying temporal properties
- **State Space Exploration**: Exploring system states
- **Property Verification**: Verifying temporal properties
- **Model Checking Tools**: Tools like SPIN, NuSMV, TLA+
