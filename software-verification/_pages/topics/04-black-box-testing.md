Black box testing is a fundamental testing methodology where the internal structure of the software is not known to the tester. Instead, testers focus on the functionality and behavior of the software based on specifications and requirements, treating the software as an opaque "black box."

## Understanding Black Box Testing

In black box testing, the tester has no knowledge of the internal code structure, implementation details, or design. The software is tested solely based on its external behavior, inputs, and outputs.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand black box testing principles
- Apply equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis
- Create test cases from specifications
- Use black box testing techniques effectively

## Key Concepts

- **Equivalence Partitioning**: Dividing input domain into equivalence classes
- **Boundary Value Analysis**: Testing at boundaries of input ranges
- **Decision Table Testing**: Testing combinations of conditions
- **State Transition Testing**: Testing state-based systems
- **Use Case Testing**: Testing based on user scenarios
